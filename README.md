# Salvodart
Which painting are you thinking of?

Salvodâ€™art is an ingenious expert system able to guess the painting the user is thinking of by questioning him. 
The game stars an artificial intelligence embodied in a miniature model of Dali which strengthens its knowledge from the interactions it has with the user. No matter what the century of the painting is and regardless of the style or the artistic movement to which it belongs, the system always has a single objective : identify the canvas with the fewest strokes possible.

Before the game starts, the user has to visualize the painting he wants to make the system guess. When he is done, the art wizard commences the interrogation. Throughout the game the user has three response options : he can give either a positive or a negative answer to the question, or else prefer admitting his ignorance. On the basis of the responses received and the paintings saved in its knowledge base, the system distinguishes between canvasses that are still candidates and those which had been eliminated. Step by step, questions asked to the user become more precise, until a tentative answer is made. In all, only two proposals can be made by the system. If after the second attempt the painting is still incorrectly identified, it concedes defeat. Then the user is allowed to complete specific fields if known, including the name of the work and its painter.
